0.17,Concern about verification: Security concern about face verification ,1.17,Benefits: easier and quicker than the usual verification,2.17,Design preference: segregating database-preventing access to irrelevant or sensitive information
0.18,Concern about verification:Security concern about iris verification ,1.18,Benefits: more trusted 3rd party involvement,2.18,Architecture preference: decentralized improve security of centrailized data storage
0.19,Concern about verification:Security concern about fingerprint verification ,1.19,Benefits: reduced risk of data linkage,2.19,Architecture preference: decentralized mitigates privacy concerns
0.20,Concern about verification: Lack of transparency/No idea how collected data will be used and shared,1.20,Benefits: tracability decrease the chance of fake accounts,2.20,Architecture preference: decentralized-users can choose preferred issuers
0.21,Concern about verification: Confused understanding of authentication as verification,1.21,Concerns: PHC/credentials getting stolen (due to hacking),2.21,Architecture preference: decentralized and sector-based
0.22,Concern about verification: Regional Difference in verification Method: Social Media,1.22,Concerns: credential's validity period,2.22,Architecture preference: clear regulation/policy for decentralized
0.23,Concern about verification: Across border: Limitation in access/interoperability in verification method ,1.23,Concerns: untrustworthy PHC issuer,2.23,Concerns: diverse user preferences who trust as issuers
